	    Hello there! I'm Daniel Aspinwall, but you can call me Vainstains. it's great you found me, since not many people know about me.
		<br>
		<br>
		I think something really cool about me, is that i taught myself everything i know about computers. no udemy, no classes, not even in school.
		i mainly program games using unity, and ive made one entirely from scratch, the blurred thing you see in the background.
		It isnt done yet, and im hoping to finish it sometime soon.
		<br>
		<br>
		as of right now, i am not doing anything major in terms of programming, since i have school, but when i'm done with school and back to summer, i like to join game jams. ive only really done two, one of which felt like a cheat. i guess i could consider it an intro? anyways thats me for ya. click the tab buttons at the top to see my currently finished projects!
